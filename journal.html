          <p class="">I have survived my first semester of college! My first semester was filled with changes, challenges, and new experiences. The biggest challenge has had to be adjusting to living by myself in a new city as I’ve never lived alone before, but I feel like I managed to adapt quite well to my new environment. I knew almost no one at the beginning of the semester, but by the end of it, I managed to make some great friends I can help and rely on. I feel like I struggled a little bit with the transition from high school to college in regards to coursework, but now I have a lot more experience with college courses and I feel more prepared to ace them in future semesters thanks to the study and work skills and lessons I’ve picked up along the way.

            <br><br>Furthermore, I have managed to put myself out there more by joining student organizations, allowing me to kickstart my professional aspirations. Also, being involved with URSP has allowed me to learn more about the research process and feel less daunted by it. The program has inspired me to consider getting involved in research in the future.
